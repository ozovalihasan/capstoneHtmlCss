# capstoneHtmlCss

This is a Microverse project as capstone. It was developed as a requirement for Microverse HTML and CSS course.

In this Microverse project, I built a AIRSHOW website similar to [ conference website](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015) . The project has 3 pages and all pages are responsive for laptop and mobile version.

Elements are aligned by using grids and flexboxes. To generate CSS code, a CSS preprocessor, SASS, is used. HTML and CSS codes are validated by using linters.

## Built With

- Html
- CSS ( SCSS )
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
